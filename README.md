# Introduction
CypressZoneDefense is a UI automation testing project designed to evaluate candidates’ skills in end-to-end (E2E) testing using Cypress. The challenge focuses on verifying various interactive elements on [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) web app, simulating real-world UI testing scenarios.

# Features
- 🚀 Automated UI tests with Cypress
- 🔍 Validates understanding of modern front-end testing
- 📊 Generates test reports for review and analysis
- 🔐 Tests key UI interactions like drag & drop, dynamic content, and alerts

# Objective
Your task is to implement and debug Cypress test cases to verify core UI functionalities of [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/). The challenge will test your ability to write robust UI automation scripts, handle dynamic elements, and debug flaky tests.

# Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository

2.	Install dependencies:

    `npm install`

4.	Run tests:

    `npx cypress run`

# Tasks
1. Implement UI Tests - Write Cypress tests for the following pages:
- Login (basic auth)
- Checkboxes
- Upload

2. Bonus tests if time permits
- Drag and Drop
- Dynamic Content
- Javascript Alert


3. Debug and Fix a Broken Test
- A pre-written test in cypress/e2e/tests/brokenTest.cy.js contains intentional issues
- Your task: Identify and fix missing assertions, incorrect selectors, or other flaws to make the test pass reliably.

# Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality & readability
- Proper use of Cypress best practices
- Ability to handle dynamic elements & UI changes
- Debugging & troubleshooting skills
